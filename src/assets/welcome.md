# Welcome
Hey! I'm Adam, software engineer from Cambridge, UK. I graduated from Durham University in 2022 with 1st class BSc in Computer Science.

I've been programming for as long as I can remember (/cliche) and it's what I love to do - making stuff. 

# Interests & Experience
I enjoy a wide variety of different fields and all the challenges each one brings. Though, I have a particular affinity for building full stack applications as I like to think I have a relatively good eye for design (for a programmer).

The majority of my experience is in JS/TS & related technologies - name a JS library/framework (FE or BE) and I'll likely be familiar with it if I've not used it in one of my many side projects.

In my current role I'm part of a team that makes a suite of high-performance commercial graph & timeline visualization libraries for the browser. It was an interesting to get started as in my previous projects I paid no mind to e2e/unit testing, no-external-library rules, or developer experience - but these are all essential skills for me now.

# What is this site?
The web app is a mock-desktop so each app on your homescreen can be opened, closed, minimized, and you can have multiples instances of each app open.

The apps are arbritrary DOM elements so what you're reading right now is just HTML rendered by Prism from a markdown file!

# Why?
I built this site for a fun way to showcase some of my projects and add a few little toys. It's written in Svelte+TS, bundled with Vite, styled with tailwind and deployed to netlify.

As a bonus; there's a few easter eggs hidden in various apps on this site. I won't spoil them but the terminal is probably a good place to start your search!
