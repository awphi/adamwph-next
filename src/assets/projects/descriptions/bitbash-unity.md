# What is bitbash-unity?

Bitbash Unity is a Unity-based port of my 2D game Bitbash. More info on the game itself can be found in the project description of <button onclick="document.querySelector('#project-btn-bitbash').focus(); document.querySelector('#project-btn-bitbash').click();">bitbash</button> itself.

This project was an attempt to improve my knowledge of Unity and accelerate development on the many ideas I had for the content of the game rather than spending time working on the engine code. However, this project helped me realise that those tricky, fine-grained problems are the ones I enjoy solving as opposed to game design.
