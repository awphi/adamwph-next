# What is enigma-ts?
`engima-ts` is a tiny library that, as the name implies, implements enigma encoding in TypeScript. It was a very interesting project to get familiar with how the enigma machine functioned and emulating it digitally.

It was also the first project that I used TypeScript in (as a previous believer JS was fine as-is). I'm glad to say I that this was enough to convert me to a TypeScript evangelist and I couldn't image writing anything more than snippets/quick hacks in plain JS anymore.
