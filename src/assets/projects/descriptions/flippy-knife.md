# What is FlippyKnife?

FlippyKnife is a web-based port of an old Unity game I made while at sixth form. It was a very simple physics game in which you would flip a knife (think flappy bird - repetitive, mindless fun). Unfortunately I lost the project when formatting an old hard drive so I decided to use the oppurtunity to learn some new JS libraries: <a href="https://pixijs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">PixiJS</a> & <a href="https://brm.io/matter-js/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">matter.js</a>.

I never got past implementing the basics of the game in these libraries but I learnt a lot about these libraries and some of their limitations.
