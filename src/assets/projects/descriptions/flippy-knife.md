# What is FlippyKnife?
FlippyKnife is a web-based port of an old Unity game I made while at sixth form. It was a very simple physics game in which you would flip a knife (think flappy bird - repetitive, mindless fun). Unfortunately I lost the project when formatting an old hard drive so I decided to use the oppurtunity to learn some new JS libraries: [PixiJS](https://pixijs.com/) & [matter.js](https://brm.io/matter-js/).

I never got past implementing the basics of the game in these libraries but I learnt a lot about these libraries and some of their limitations.
