# What is awphos?

`awphos` is a complete re-write of this site with a much wider scope. It's built in Next.js and takes advantage of Redux for global state management because of its excellent dev tooling, Radix for common accessible React components, tailwind for styling and a whole bunch of custom browser-API shenanigans to build a robust, performant window management system.

I hope to replace this version of the site with `awphos` eventually once its at feature parity as despite my love for Svelte, React just has a much larger ecosystem.
