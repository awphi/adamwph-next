# What is bitbash?

Bitbash is a top-down 2D survival/exploration game heavily inspired by the likes of <a href="https://terraria.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Terraria</a> or <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Minecraft</a>. It's a self-written engine in Kotlin using <a href="https://libgdx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">LibGDX</a> which was largely a joy to work with.

I really enjoy architecting projects from scratch with flexible tools like LibGDX that give you the freedom to do as you wish (and often make mistakes!). The game features infinite world generation, full game state saving/loading, intelligent rendering layers, lighting, 2D physics and tile placement/destruction.
