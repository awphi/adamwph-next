# What is idlefish?

`idlefish` is a simple idle fishing game to play in the browser. It's very minimal but I used it as an oppurtunity to learn more about PIXI, creating shader programs for WebGL and complex state management in Svelte.

An up-to-date demo can be found <a href="https://idlefish.vercel.app/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.
