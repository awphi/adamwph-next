# What is ddz?

`ddz` is a web app for playing Chinese cards games like Dou Di Zhu (斗地主) on your device without the need for physical playing cards in a pinch. It's intended to make this game and other excellent Chinese poker variations accessible to English-speaking audiences online.

It's comprised of two pieces - a core JS library that implements the game logic, validation, scoring and a web app that consumes said library to allow users to play in a pass-the-phone style.

While the web app is relatively immature, the core library is fully-fleshed out in terms of implementing Dou Di Zhu (斗地主) including a generic game server, complex scoring rules and robust test suite to keep everything in check.
