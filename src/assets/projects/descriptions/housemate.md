# What is housemate?
`housemate` is a <a href="https://firebase.google.com/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">firebase</a>-backed progressive web app (PWA) for managing simple shared household tasks with notes and timers. I built this out for a friend at University who often encountered trouble from having to descend from the top floor to the basement to find the washing machine running. It's a small annoyance but something that can easily be solved.

The app also supports shared notes with due dates/post times for reminders like buying household essentials etc. It's a responsive mobile-first site built in Vue leveraging firebase's realtime database for instant, performant data syncronishation.
