# What is runelite?
<a href="https://runelite.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Runelite</a> is an open-source extensible <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Old-School RuneScape</a> client. I'm  very fond of OSRS and thus this project is my fork of Runelite.

It's quite inactive today as I've mostly stepped away from the game and Runelite has changed a lot since I last touched it. My largest (and only) contribution to the project was the <a href="https://github.com/runelite/runelite/blob/master/runelite-client/src/main/java/net/runelite/client/plugins/inventoryviewer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">`InventoryViewer` plugin</a>.

The code has obviously evolved over time but my name is still there in the copywrite notice :). This technically makes this small plugin my most widely ditributed and used work.
