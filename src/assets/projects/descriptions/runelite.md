# What is runelite?
[Runelite](https://runelite.net/) is an open-source extensible [Old-School RuneScape](https://oldschool.runescape.com/) client. I'm  very fond of OSRS and thus this project is my fork of Runelite.

It's quite inactive today as I've mostly stepped away from the game and Runelite has changed a lot since I last touched it. My largest (and only) contribution to the project was the [`InventoryViewer` plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/blob/master/runelite-client/src/main/java/net/runelite/client/plugins/inventoryviewer). 

The code has obviously evolved over time but my name is still there in the copywrite notice :). This technically makes this small plugin my most widely ditributed and used work.
