# What is adamwph?

This repository is the now deprecated version of this website. It was an SPA much like one but written in Vue and thus was a fair bit slower. It also had a far more limited scope, only containing the `Terminal` app from this site and that's it.

In early 2023 I re-wrote this site in <a href="https://svelte.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Svelte</a> and expanded the scope to include multiple apps like this GitHub project explorer. The code for this overhaul is currently not open source and thus doesn't appear on the GitHub Project Explorer.
