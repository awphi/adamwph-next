# What is fishgame?

`fishgame` is the WIP spiritual successor to `idlefish` focusing on better fundamentals and a more robust networking solution. Mostly the project is a playground for me to use Go with gorilla for a backend service, Svelte on the frontend and protobufs for efficienct communication between the two.
