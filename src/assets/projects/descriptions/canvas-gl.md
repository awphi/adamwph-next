# What is canvas-gl?

`canvas-gl` is a `regl`-based wrapper around WebGL to give it a friendlier interface with some out-of-the-box drawing commands similar to the plain old CanvasRenderingContext2D API.

The API is designed to be friendly to someone who neither knows nor cares about WebGL and just wants to draw some stuff on the canvas quickly. Using this library will not be as performant as writing your own project-specific implementation.
