# What is security-coursework?
`security-coursework` was the summative project of the Cybersecurity module I took in my 2nd year at Durham University. It was a very enjoyable and creative coursework where we were given a disk image of "a company server" and just had to exploit it and find as many vulnerabilities as possible.

The report I produced contained ~20 vulnerabilities from buffer overflows, stack smashing, known-plaintext ECB decryption, various common web vulnerabilities etc.

I learned a lot about common utilities that make otherwise tedious-to-write scripts very quick and accessible like `hashcat`, `fcrackzip` and also learned some basic memory exploits which is something I'd never touched before.
