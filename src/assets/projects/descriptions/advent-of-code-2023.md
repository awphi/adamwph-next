# What is advent-of-code-2023?

`advent-of-code-2023` is the repository hosting my solutions to <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Advent of Code 2023</a>. I used 2023's AoC as an oppurtunity to challenge myself to get out of my comfort zone and learn more about languages I was interested in. Specifically I used plain C using only libc for the first few days before moving over to C++ with the STL in later days.

My aim in 2024 is to improve my proficiency in C++ specifically and AoC served as a great kick start to this resolution!
