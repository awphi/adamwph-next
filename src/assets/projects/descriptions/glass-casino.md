# What is GlassCasino?
GlassCasino was my third year BSc Computer Science project @ Durham University. The full paper is available on this site in PDF form as `my-bachelors-paper.pdf` on the desktop. This project was a large part of my 1st class grade.

The project is still hosted today at <a href="https://glasscasino.netlify.app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">glasscasino.netlify.app</a> and its full code including all smart contracts is available in the repo above.

# Abstract
In this work, we build a decentralised, secure and trustless online casino platform by leveraging modern public blockchain
networks and tooling. In doing so, we evaluate the technical viability of such a platform and evaluate its technical viability regarding its
speed, scalability, and cost. We do this in the context of negative public opinion regarding online gambling, particularly pertaining to its
trustworthiness. 

We implement two different popular casino games; roulette and dice on the blockchain alongside a secondary bank
management program. These are accessed via our second deliverable; a lightweight, responsive web app with blockchain integration.
Finally, we conclude that, while it is feasible to build a platform that is decentralised, trustless, and secure, it is a mere proof of concept
due to its inability to scale in speed or throughput. However, given more mature or better-suited blockchain implementations we find it
to be likely to scale significantly better.
