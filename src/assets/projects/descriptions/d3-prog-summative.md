# What is d3-prog-summative?
This project was part of one of my first year programming modules at Durham University. The project was extremely simple but aimed to teach good practices. The project consists of a flexible JavaScript class for visualizing a tree map given arbritrary data.

It wraps <a href="https://d3js.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">d3js</a> to do the actual rendering and supports dynamic updates of colours, sizing etc. This project helped me learn about JSDoc and ESLint when I was quite new to JavaScript development as prior to university I primarily used Java or Kotlin for practically all my side projects.
