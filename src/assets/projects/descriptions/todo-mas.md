# What is todo-mas?

TodoMás is a beautifully simple task tracker app designed for technical users. I built it to address shortcomings I came across when trialling off-the-shelf task tracking apps like TickTick, Todoist with some inspiration from more fully-featured organisational apps like Notion and Obsidian.

The goals for TodoMás are:

- Extremely lightweight client that can be downloaded locally as a PWA
- Markdown-first interface to make your notes easy to write and import into other tools
- Privacy-focused login system inspired by Mullvad VPN where auth is controlled by nothing but a unique user ID
- Realtime cross-device syncing
- Easy to self-host backend with a frontend that supports multi-user login connecting to an arbitrary backend

As of writing, much of this is in flight but some bits are already implemented.
